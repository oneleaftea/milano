### _a minimal hugo theme_

**Milano** is a Hugo theme based on [Xmin](https://xmin.yihui.name/) by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name). In the spirit of Xmin, this theme does not use any javascript or use any complex css like bootstrap. However, several changes were made to the layout and features available in this theme. 

A number of features added:

* Added support for **clickable tags** to show in posts
* Added support for **Google Fonts**. Simply add your favorite Google font in ```config.toml```
* Added **social media links** to the footer, using Font-Awesome
* Added **pagination** to ```list.html``` with customization available in ```config.toml```. This adds arrows to the bottom of the homepage as well as other list pages (e.g. ```/post/```)
* Added **Disqus** and **Google Analytics** Support (just add your short-name and GA site-id to ```config.toml```)
* Added highlighting option (see accent parameter in ```config.toml```)
* Added **Related Posts** feature
* Made modifications to the overall look and style

As with Xmin, it is fully functional. It supports pages (including the home page), blog posts, a navigation menu, categories, tags, and RSS. 

All pages not under the root directory of the website are listed below. You can also visit the list page of a single section, e.g., [posts](/post/). See the [About](/page/about/) page for the usage of this theme.
